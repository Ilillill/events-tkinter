# events-tkinter
A simple app written in Python and TKInter to manage events, anniversaries and important dates

This app, written in Python and Tkinter, allows users to manage events, anniversaries, and important dates.

Instead of displaying a traditional calendar view, it shows the number of days until or since each event, making it easy to see all upcoming and past events at a glance.

The app also includes an SQLite database manager and the ability to export data as JSON, allowing for easy backups and the use of other tools to work with the data.

Key features include the ability to track time until and since events, keep a diary, and view durations between selected entries, as well as the user's age during important dates.
